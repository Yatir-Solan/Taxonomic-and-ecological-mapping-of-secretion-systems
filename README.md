# Taxonomic-and-ecological-mapping-of-secretion-systems
<h3>Description</h3>
Profile HMMs and code scripts of the research pipeline and figures from a manuscript titled (currently undergoing peer review) 'Global-scale analysis of the taxonomic and ecological distribution of key pathogenic secretion systems.â€™

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
Rather than a given product, the materials available in this repository are given due to demonstration and disclosure reasons. The code implemented in this project is heavily environment-dependent, and many supporting features that are crucial for a complete run are absent. In addition, some files, e.g., various databases, hmmsearch files, and of course the huge FASTA files, are excluded due to memory reasons.

<h3>Files guide</h3>
bio_utilities - general auxiliary scripts handling specific biological and bioinformatics content, such as GFF parsers, genomic databases, taxonomical issues, etc.
cluster_utilities - general auxiliary scripts handling computational issues within the lab cluster.
research_pipleine_scripts - the actual scripts to run the project. For a better understanding, follow the "main.py" script, where other scripts and functions are called.
figures_scripts - Jupyter notebooks and other scripts for code-generated main figures (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5).

<h3>Citation</h3>
The manuscript describing this project is currently undergoing peer review. Citation or scientific usage of these materials will become optional in the future.
