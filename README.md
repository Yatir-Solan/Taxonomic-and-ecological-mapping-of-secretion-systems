<h3>Description</h3>
Profile HMMs and code scripts of the research pipeline and figures from a manuscript titled (currently undergoing peer review) 'Global-scale analysis of the taxonomic and ecological distribution of key pathogenic secretion systems.â€™

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
Rather than a given product, the materials available in this repository are given due to demonstration and disclosure reasons. The code implemented in this project is heavily environment-dependent. Therefore, many supporting features which are crucial for a complete run, are excluded. In addition, some files, e.g., various databases, hmmsearch files, and of course the huge FASTA files, are excluded due to memory reasons.

<h3>Citation</h3>
The manuscript describing this project is currently undergoing peer review. Citation or scientific usage of these materials will become optional in the future.
